SalesforcePy: Documentation
===========================

The reason this package exists is to produce:

1. A Salesforce client that is reusable, minimalistic, and pythonic
2. Interfaces that are closely knit to the Salesforce Rest API service specification
3. Gradual support for the Salesforce API extended family (ie. Chatter, Analytics, Wave, Tooling, Bulk, Metadata, etc.)
