SalesforcePy
============

An absurdly simple package for making Salesforce Rest API calls.

by Aaron Caffrey, Colin Cheevers, Jose Garcia, Tania Prince

This package enables you to produce:

1. A Salesforce client that is reusable, minimalistic, and pythonic.
2. Interfaces that are closely knit into the Salesforce Rest API service specification.
3. Gradual support for the Salesforce API extended family (i.e., Chatter, Analytics, Wave, Tooling, Bulk, Metadata, and so on).
